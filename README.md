# Binary-Helper
This project was built with Facebook's Reactjs library.

This was made as a tool for binary addition and subtraction.

# Usage
Simply enter a binary expression with two binary numbers such as 1001 + 01 which should result as ten. Likewise, you can subtract binary. The result will appear in hex, binary, and decimal as well.
